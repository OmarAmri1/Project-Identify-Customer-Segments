# Customer Segmentation with Arvato

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used by Arvato to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 

## Libraries used

* Python 
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
